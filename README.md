# Introduction to Numerical Methods for Simulating Batch Reactor Exercises
Here we have the exercises for Euler methods.

The files are as follows:
- `exercises.ipynb`: The worksheet of all the exercises with helper code.
- `exercises_completed.ipnyb`: The worksheet with all the answers. Avoid the temptation to cheat :)
- `lecture_slides.pdf`: The lecture slides (note some figures do not present correctly in PDF form)

To try these out without having to download anything, please go to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pulsipher/eulercourse/master). 

Alternatively, you can use [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pulsipher/eulercourse/blob/master/exercises.ipynb) to assess `exercises.ipynb`.
