# Introduction to Numerical Methods for Simulating Dynamic Systems Exercises
Here we have the exercises for Euler methods.

The files are as follows:
- `basics.ipnyb`: The basic syntax you'll need to complete the exercises.
- `exercises.ipynb`: The worksheet of all the exercises with helper code.
- `exercises.ipnyb`: The worksheet with all the answers.
- `lecture_slides.pdf`: The lecture slides (note some figures do not present correctly in PDF form)

The exercises are available in Python or Julia in the respective `python` and `julia` folders.
